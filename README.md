# SAS Training

This repository holds the solutions to cases which I developed as part of the SAS 9.4 Training on Coursera.

`TSAClaims/tsa_claims.sas` was written by me and was my solution to `TSAClaims/caseStudySpecifications.sas`

`TSAClaims/data_setup.sas` was a script provided by the course to generate the datasets
